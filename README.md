# Python Calculator
A simple, interactive command-line calculator built with Python. This program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and supports chaining calculations for seamless use.

## Features
- Basic Arithmetic Operations:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)
- Chained Calculations: Continue calculations using the previous result.
- Dynamic Functionality: Choose operations dynamically using a dictionary-based operation mapping.
- Recursive Restart: Start a new calculation session without restarting the program.

## How it works
1. Enter First Number:
- Input the initial number for calculation.
2. Choose an Operation:
- Select from the displayed list of operations (+, -, *, /).
3. Enter Second Number:
- Provide the second number to complete the operation.
4. Chaining Calculations:
- Decide whether to continue with the current result or start a new operation.
5. Output Result:
- The program displays the result of each operation.

## Future Requirements
- Add support for advanced mathematical operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., dividing by zero).
- Build a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use.
